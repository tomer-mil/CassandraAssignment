# Cassandra Assignment
A home assignment in practical use of the Cassandra framework and AstraDB as part of my Big Data Systems course

## Assignment Requirements
The objective is to ingest a dataset containing user reviews scrapped from Amazon.com and to support some basic queries.
To simplify things, you are not required to create any UI. Instead, you would need to implement
some functions (`HW2API`) that would be executed by a CLI which is also provided.
